Playing with Gone
=================

You're going to write a compiler for a small language called Gone.
This directory is a playground where you can try the language
and write some small programs.  You should do this before you
start on the main compiler project.

There are three programs here: prog1.g, prog2.g, prog3.g.  Go to each
program and follow the instructions inside. You can run each program
using the provided program `begone.py`.  For example:

   $ python3 begone.py prog1.g
   ... see the output ...

Don't concern yourself too much with the details of the `begone.py`
program (if you must know, it's running each program in an interpreter
which is sort of similar to the compiler you're going to write except
that everything runs a lot slower).
